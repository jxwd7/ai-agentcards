The previous AI engineer successfully built a multi-faceted web application for creating AI agent teams without code. The project evolved from a guided 6-step wizard to an AI-powered auto-generation system, and finally to a revolutionary voice-controlled interface using LiveKit. The engineer meticulously addressed user requirements, refined the wizard flow, integrated various APIs (OpenAI, Emergent LLM, LiveKit, Deepgram), and performed extensive debugging for both backend and frontend components.

A significant challenge was integrating LiveKit for real-time voice, which involved multiple iterations of debugging token generation and package dependencies. The core architecture comprises a FastAPI backend handling AI logic, data management, and API key handling, coupled with a React frontend providing three distinct user experiences. The engineer was in the process of debugging a  in the LiveKit voice agent when the trajectory ended, indicating the voice assistant functionality, while largely configured, was not fully operational.

<product_requirements>
The business goal is to eliminate the 'Configuration Barrier' for SMEs, enabling non-technical domain experts to create AI agent teams without coding. Target users are non-technical Subject Matter Experts.

**Core Features & Evolution:**
1.  **Guided Wizard Experience:** Initially a 5-step process, refined to a 6-step flow (Mission Definition, Task Decomposition, Role & Persona Assignment, Tool Identification, Workflow Orchestration, Review & Generation). This educational flow teaches users multi-agent system construction.
2.  **AI-Assisted Persona Generation:** Users provide simple inputs (e.g., job title); AI generates detailed personas (goal, backstory). Utilizes OpenAI API (user-provided key) or Emergent LLM Key.
3.  **Simple Tool and Workflow Selection:** Select tools from a checklist (e.g., Google Search -> , Website Search -> , Read a File -> ) and choose collaboration style (Sequential/Hierarchical).
4.  **One-Click YAML Generation:** After review, generate a 100% syntactically valid CrewAI YAML configuration file.
5.  **AI-First Auto-Generation (Enhanced Wizard):** A major enhancement where the AI automatically generates a complete task breakdown, expert roles, detailed personas, recommended tools, and a suggested workflow from a mission statement. Users then review and edit this configuration through an interactive dashboard with drag-and-drop task reordering and inline editing.
6.  **Voice Conversational AI Assistant (LiveKit Integration):** A third, revolutionary option allowing users to create AI agent teams through natural voice conversation, leveraging LiveKit for real-time audio, Deepgram for Speech-to-Text, OpenAI for Text-to-Speech, and the existing LLM integration for conversational AI and team generation.

**Success Criteria:**
*   Non-technical users create valid CrewAI YAML in under 10 minutes (AI-First: 2-3 mins, Voice: 1-2 mins).
*   Intuitive UI requiring no external documentation.
*   Generated YAML works flawlessly with CrewAI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging the LiveKit Voice Conversational AI Assistant. The frontend UI for the voice assistant is functional and accessible, and the backend API for LiveKit token generation () is successfully providing valid tokens. However, the voice assistant itself was reported by the user as still not working.

The engineer identified a  when trying to test the  script, which is crucial for the backend voice processing. The engineer then inspected the available LiveKit Agents API and discovered the correct module to use is . The latest action involved rewriting  to use this corrected API structure. The current state is that the  file has just been edited, and the immediate next step in the trajectory is to test if this fix allows the voice agent to import correctly. The overall voice assistant functionality remains unverified and is the primary focus of the ongoing work.
